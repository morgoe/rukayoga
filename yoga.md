			We also offer classes, events, memberships and packages that are not currently available through the Mindbody app. Please contact us to purchase or find out more.
		</p>
		<p>
			NB: Our yoga shala is not a big franchise - it is an independent studio, and each assigned teacher does also their classâ€™ reception work. We insist therefore you arrive <strong>10-15 minutes before</strong> the commencement of classes, so we can check you in and have you settle, pick your spot and mat, do some gentle warm up at your own pace, and hydrate before class. Please understand we must close the doors as soon as class begins. <strong>Those who arrive after class has started will not be let in</strong>, as it would disturb the experience of the other participants
