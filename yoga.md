			Booking a class is easy. Just use the schedule below to find a class that suits you, create your account, and you're done. If you're a regular, you can download the <a class="link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/momoyoga/id1233882505?mt=8">iPhone</a> or <a class="link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.momostudio.momoyoga">Android</a> app.

			We also offer classes, events, memberships and packages that are not currently available through the Momoyoga app. Please contact us to purchase or find out more. On Wednesdays and Saturdays, there are prenatal classes we are running in partnership with Mother Nurture Yoga. <strong>More information and all prenatal bookings are available through the <a class="link" href="https://www.mothernurtureyoga.com.au/timetable-and-costs">Mother Nurture website</a>.</strong>

			NB: Our yoga shala is not a big franchise - it is an independent studio, and each assigned teacher does also their classâ€™ reception work. We ask you to please arrive <strong>min. 5 minutes before</strong> the commencement of classes, so we can check you in and have you settle, pick your spot and mat, do some gentle warm up at your own pace, and hydrate before class.
