			Dynamic Fusion Flow
		</h3>
		<p>
			A challenging series of vinyasa fusion sequences which combine dynamic movement with holding postures, linking both the dynamic and the static with the breath. Its inspiration springs from the ashtanga vinyasa tradition, DMT, interval training, pilates. Its purpose is to build and consolidate strength, flexibility, but also body awareness and mind clarity while you explore a range of asanas (poses). Be ready to flow, play, and experiment with your practice. You will walk away feeling empowered, refreshed and energised. Open to all levels; while more experienced students can go to the deepest depths of it, beginners will be offered simplified variations of each pose in the sequence. However, we recommend attending a Foundation Vinyasa or a Slow Fusion Flow, if this is your first approach to yoga ever. 
		</p>

		<h3>
			Slow Fusion Flow
		</h3>
		<p>
			Vinyasa fusion yoga that involves gentle transitions from one posture to the next, synchronising breath and movement into a smooth and more meditative flow. Anchored in the Classical Hatha tradition but also in Kinesiology, it brings together yoga asana and pranayama with modern elements of functional training, dynamic stretching and calisthenics.
		</p>
		</p>
			An opportunity to move at a slower pace, allowing for your muscles to heat gradually, for energy to build and your breath to deepen, giving you time to explore and feel the benefits of each asana at a time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Don’t dismiss this series of sequences, if you’re an advanced practitioner - it’ll be sure to challenge you in different ways from the dynamic flow.  
		</p>

		<h3>
			Partnered Yoga
		</h3>
		<p>
			This class is designed to exercise, fly, stretch, and strengthen with your lover, friend or family member, in postures where linked breathing and moving together is key through a creative flow sequences.
		</p>
		<p>
			The benefits of practicing yoga with a partner are countless, but some includes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				flexibility, strength, massage techniques, balance, and partner-assisting skills
			</li>
			<li>
				Improved levels of communication,  connection, playfulness, deeper expressions of postures, and the encouragement of trust.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>
			Yin
		</h3>
		<p>
			This class is fantastic for both building strength and improving flexibility of both body and mind. This well balanced yin offering will be a treat for your whole body-mind and allow your nervous system a chance to balance and renew. This class will be non-heated but the room will be an ambient temperature during the cooler months.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Foundation
		</h3>
		<p>
			In this 6 week rolling series, which you can join at any stage, we will look at the foundational aspects of vinyasa yoga.
			The Foundations classes are structured for students who are new to yoga. Each class will be well balanced, strengthening and relaxing and will provide a glimpse into the deeper transformational aspects that a consistent and long-term practice can offer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Appropriate for complete beginners, while also being challenging for experienced practitioners who like to move a slower pace.  It will be slower and more focused than an Open class. These classes are designed to build your foundations so that you can safely progress into Open classes with confidence.
		</p>

		<h3>Private Session</h3>
		<p>
			Private session is designed to fill all your needs, it includes anatomy assessment and custom class.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Donation Flow
		</h3>
		<p>
			A 75-minute vinyasa flow. This Saturday morning class is an ideal way to send off the week as you build heat through creative flow sequences, slowing down to complete relaxation poses and stillness. This class is open-level and donation based (pay what feels right).
