      <h2>Step 4. Enjoy the Studio</h2>

      <p>We have a gorgeous space we poured a lot of love - and work - into, that was deemed the most ecological studio in Australia . Everything we use in this space, from the mats and props to the oils and candles, to the soaps and floor cleaning products and even toilet paper (yay! Who Gives a Cr*p) is ethically sourced and has been very thoughtfully chosen as the most sustainable option of its kind on the market. Make yourself comfortable and treat the space with the love it’s treating you back!</p>
