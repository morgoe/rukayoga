      <h2>Step 4. Enjoy the Studio</h2>

      <p>We have a gorgeous space we poured a lot of love - and work - into, that was deemed the most ecological studio in Australia . Everything we use in this space, from the mats and props to the oils and candles, to the soaps and floor cleaning products and even toilet paper (yay! Who Gives a Cr*p) is ethically sourced and has been very thoughtfully chosen as the most sustainable option of its kind on the market. Make yourself comfortable and treat the space with the love itâ€™s treating you back!</p>
