YogaRuka provides yoga sessions taught by the best independent teachers. YogaRuka also provides the space for independent teachers and therapists to provide services such as Pilates, workshops and treatments. All payments for these services are accepted by YogaRuka on behalf of the teacher or therapist.

YogaRuka reserves the right to cancel, change or vary classes, teachers, workshops or teacher training programs. While we endeavour to give you as much notice as we can, this may not always be possible. Please check live timetables for up-to-date information on all classes and events.


### Online Bookings

You are welcome to pre-book online for all of our classes, and this is highly recommended at peak times. If you are unable to attend you must cancel online. Failure to cancel or “no-show” will result in you being charged for the pre-booked class.

If you have pre-booked a class, you must still register at reception so that we know you’ve arrived.
You will need to arrive at least 15 minutes prior to claim your spot otherwise it may be given away to another student.


### Late-Arrivals & Leaving Class Early

Late arrivals will only be admitted into a 60 minute class if they can be on the mat in a quiet and respectful manner within the first 5 minutes of the class.

Should you wish to leave class early please alert the teacher and make sure your mat is at the back of the class in order not to disturb other students. We understand occasionally you may need to leave class early but if this is a regular pattern we suggest you make sure you sign into a class you know you can fully commit to.


### Memberships

For all membership enquiries, pass suspensions and cancellations, please email us at studio@yogaruka.com.

One week notice is required to cancel, after minimum contract period is complete.

Minimum contract period for Monthly Membership is 3 months (3 debits). At the end of the minimum contract number, the membership will continue on a monthly basis unless you notify us by email with minimum one week notice of your intent to discontinue membership.


### Suspensions

If you are on an Auto-Membership, you are welcome to hold or suspend your pass for holiday or business travel, or if you are unable to practice due to serious illness or injury. 

One week notice in writing prior to the suspension date is required. Pass suspensions cannot be applied retroactively.

Minimum suspension period for all passes is 7 days. Maximum suspension period is 14 days per 3 months membership period, a total of 56 days per year.

Please note that we do not allow suspended memberships to be cancelled. One billing period must be completed after suspension and prior to cancelling membership.


### Passes

All passes are non-refundable, non-transferrable and cannot be exchanged for any other pass.

Passes purchased online will activate upon your first visit.

Introductory 3-Week Passes are a one-time offer to all new attendees at YogaRuka.


### Concession Passes

Concessions are available for full-time students, community VIPs, seniors and pensioners only.

Not available for purchase online, as valid ID must be sighted. Acceptable ID includes seniors and pension cards, or proof of enrolment in full-time University or TAFE course.


### Private Yoga Classes

For all private classes we have a strict 24 hour cancellation policy. If you do not cancel via email or change your appointment within 24 hours, or if you do not attend your session, you will be charged the full fee.

The booking confirmation and appointment reminder emails you receive are the date and time for which you will be charged.
