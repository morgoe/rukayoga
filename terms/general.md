YogaRuka provides movement sessions (yoga, mixed mobility, Pilates, Stretch Therapy™, etc) taught by the best independent teachers. YogaRuka also provides the space for independent teachers and therapists to provide services such as movement classes, workshops and treatments. All payments for these services are accepted by YogaRuka on behalf of the teacher or therapist.

YogaRuka reserves the right to cancel, change or vary classes, teachers, workshops or teacher training programs. While we endeavour to give you as much notice as we can, this may not always be possible. Please check live timetables for up-to-date information on all classes and events. YogaRuka also reserves the right to reasonably adjust pricing of class passes and expiry brackets. All these changes will be announced at least a month before taking place. 


### Online Bookings

You are welcome to pre-book online for all of our classes, and this is highly recommended at peak times. If you are unable to attend you must cancel online at least 3 hours prior. Failure to cancel or “no-show” will result in you being charged for the pre-booked class.

If you have pre-booked a class, you must still check in upon arrival so that we know you’ve arrived. You will need to arrive at least 5 minutes prior to claim your spot otherwise it may be given away to another student.


### Late-Arrivals & Leaving Class Early

Late arrivals for the 45-minute classes are not accepted. They will only be accepted into the 60-minute and 75-minute classes if you can be on the mat in a quiet and respectful manner within the first 5 minutes of the class.

Should you need to leave class early please alert the teacher and make sure your mat is at the back of the class in order not to disturb other students. We understand you may occasionally need to leave class early but if this is a regular pattern we suggest you make sure you sign into a class you know you can fully commit to.


### Memberships

Our twice-a-week and unlimited memberships are charged monthly, for the one month ahead. 
Both memberships have no fixed term now, however one week notice is required to cancel any membership. 

The membership will continue on a monthly basis indefinitely unless you notify us by email with minimum one week notice of your intent to discontinue membership.


### Class Passes

All passes are non-refundable, non-transferrable and cannot be exchanged for any other pass.
Passes purchased online will activate upon your first visit.

Introductory 2-Week unlimited Passes are a one-time offer to all new attendees at YogaRuka.
The Groupon 10-class pass can only be acquired once and strictly as an alternative to the intro offer of two-weeks unlimited. They cannot under any circumstance be used together, or one after the other. 

Drop in passes are valid for one month from purchase, and can be used for one visit. 
All our multi-class passes are valid now for 3 months from activation. 

Discounted passes may have different conditions to the above so make sure to check with Reception or the teacher to confirm conditions before purchase. 


### Suspensions

If you are on an Auto-Membership, you are welcome to hold or suspend your membership for holiday or business travel, or if you are unable to practice due to serious illness or injury.
One week notice in writing prior to the suspension date is required. Membership suspensions cannot be applied retroactively.
Minimum suspension period for memberships is 7 days. Maximum suspension period is 14 days per 3 months membership period, a total of 56 days per year.
Please note that we do not allow suspended memberships to be cancelled. One billing period (30 days) must be completed after suspension and prior to cancelling membership.

Class passes cannot be suspended or cancelled under any circumstance.

For all membership enquiries, suspensions and cancellations, please email us at studio@yogaruka.com.


### Concession Passes

Concessions are available for kids, students, disadvantaged categories, seniors and pensioners only.
If you purchase online, a valid ID must still be sighted when you come to class. At failure to do so we reserve the right to ask you to pay the difference toward a full membership or pass, or limit the number of days/classes on it.  

Acceptable ID includes seniors and pension cards, Centrelink cards, or proof of enrolment in University or TAFE course. 


### Private Yoga Classes

For all private classes we have a strict 24-hour cancellation policy. If you do not cancel via phone or email or change your appointment within 24 hours, or if you do not attend your session, you will be charged 50% of the full fee.

The booking confirmation and appointment reminder emails you receive are the date and time for which you will be charged.


### Intake Forms 

We ask all our first-timers to fill in an intake form that will gather detailed information in regards to your residence, points of contact (incl. GP of choice), age, and medical history. We  commit to keep anything pertaining to you that you have communicated to us orally and in writing confidential, however refraining from giving us the requested information may result in us refusing your participation to Exercise.
