		<div class="m-review-message">Rua is a great resource; she works patiently, conscientiously and effectively. As a complete neophyte to yoga, it was important for me to start with someone who would take my level of abilities into consideration. The routines she planned for me both challenged me with and taught me basics at a level where I was able to both participate and understand what I was doing and why, despite being a Skype session. Able and willing to describe the science in the practice, Rua managed to make me feel comfortable in a completely new system from my first class with her.</div>

		<div class="m-review-message">Yoga has always been for me something too complex that can only be done by people that are special or more spiritual than I.. Rua has helped me discover that yoga can be practiced by anyone if you let yourself bend both mentally and physically. I feel cheated now if I go to a usual studio yoga class because it feels more like gym class and I cannot have less than what I've experienced with Rua. Thank you for showing me what yoga means, for teaching me the asanas and for the both peaceful and exhilarating sessions we had!</div>

		<div class="m-review-message">Ah, where do I start with this lovely teacher!  I've been taking Rua’s yoga classes in India, and I absolutely love her teaching style! She incorporates the perfect imperfect hatha yoga class :)  I came out of the class feeling so much more opened and relaxed. She is sure to warm us up in the beginning of class and cool us down as well. And as a yoga instructor myself I really appreciate her well-thought out sequences. I highly recommend Rua's class to all hatha & vinyasa yoga lovers out there!</div>

		<div class="m-review-message">When I coincidentally met Rua in Kashmir, I was really impressed during my involvement to her yoga program. By the way, it was her first official lessons after Rishikesh training.. Her instructions were so lucid and the transitions between asanas were so smooth. The general flow of the lesson was highly soulful and dynamic. I felt not like an instructor but as a student. Congratulations Rua! Namaste.</div>

		<div class="m-review-message">One of the best places to learn everything you need to know about yoga. Rua was a good student in my class and I’m pleased to see how good a teacher she become. Which I knew she would: She has honesty, she has dedication. Truly listens and truly watches. She puts whole effort into perfecting the Yoga Asana. Her class always stays active her sequence interesting and also scientific. She knowledgably helps students deepen and settle in the pose.</div>
