#### Dynamic Fusion Flow

A challenging set of Vinyasa Fusion sequences, it samples dynamic and static asanas in an organic flow guided by the breath. Its inspiration springs from the Ashtanga Vinyasa tradition intertwined with DMT (Dynamic Movement Therapy), interval training, and Pilates. You will build and consolidate **strength, stamina, stability and litheness, re-awaken your body awareness and clarity of mind** while exploring progressive postural ranges. You’ll have the opportunity to challenge yourself and experiment with your practice, come out more confident, restored, recharged. 

Open to all levels; while more experienced students can go to its deepest depths, beginners will be offered simplified variations of each pose in the flow. However, we recommend attending a Foundation, a Hatha Fusion or a Focused Movement class for your first approach to yoga ever. 

#### Slow Fusion Flow
 
Vinyasa Fusion that involves gentle transitions from one posture to the next, synchronising breath and movement into a smooth and more meditative flow. Anchored in the Classical Hatha tradition but also in kinesiology and kinanthropometry, it brings together yoga asana and pranayama with modern elements of functional training, dynamic stretching and calisthenics. 
An opportunity **to move at a slower pace, allowing for your muscles to heat gradually with the breath that deepens, giving you time to contemplate the deeper purpose of each asana at a time**.

Don’t dismiss this series of sequences if you’re an advanced practitioner - it’ll be sure to challenge you in different ways from the Dynamic Fusion Flow. 

#### Hatha Fusion

Stamina-building, progressing sequences designed to **prepare body and mind for vigorous shifts in energy**. In the spirit of traditional Indian yoga, blended with principles of ST (Stretch Therapy) and functional training.
Each of the seven sets follow a pre-defined structure that adds to itself week after week. They focus alternatively on: neck and shoulders; upper back; lower back; core and quads; hips/pelvis; upper limbs and hands; lower limbs and feet. A 15-minute breath work/Pranayama will flow into a 15 to 20-minute long “warm up”/Pawanmuktasana series, and from there into a condensed, strong main sequence finalised in a deep, 15-minute long relaxation. 

This is an intense, albeit meditative, practice through which you will enhance your **strength and endurance, improve circulation, mobility, and internal organ function, while working toward boosting your mind power**.  

#### Focused Movement 
 
This class is a special treat for those who want to **explore a different kind of practice**, for those who need a **full walking, sitting and standing postural reset**, for those who are happy to go with the flow, for those interested in alternative forms of yoga such as Japanese Zen yoga, yoga therapy, Jivamukti yoga, but also Tai Chi, contemporary dance, myofascial release techniques, YTU (Yoga TuneUp), and more.  

#### Foundations Course

A 6 week rolling series, which you can join at any stage, to delve into the fundamentals of Hatha, various slow and fast flows, and functional movement for Western bodies and lifestyle.
The “Foundations” classes are paced and **structured to increase in difficulty very gradually**, so those **completely new to yoga or living a sedentary lifestyle, can stay safe and feel confident to follow**. Each class will offer insights into the **immediate physical and mental health benefits** of the asana practice, and hopefully provide a glimpse into other aspects of yoga, and the deeper transformation that a consistent long-term practice can catalyse.
Appropriate for any age and range of motion, it will be facilitated by two teachers simultaneously so each participant can get full attention and assistance when needed. 

Although created with true beginners in mind, this course has been refined over the past 2 years to fill what we perceive as a gap in the Western approach to yoga: the unlearning of bad  method can completely fill. At the end of the “Foundations” Course you will be fully equipped to safely progress into all the other YogaRuka classes - and most yoga classes around the world - with poise and cognisance.
 
#### Restorative + Meditation 

Mellow, and a great complement to a more active practice, this class is all about **slowing down and opening the body**, and will work as an **excellent antidote to stress and tension**. Props here will be used to support your body so the muscles can thoroughly release. It will be followed by a 15-20 minute long meditation. 

The room will be heated during the cooler months and we provide blankets, however please bring multi-layered clothing since it’s important to keep the joints warm throughout.

#### Yin Yoga

Phenomenal for **quieting the mind and body while improving self-knowledge, endurance and flexibility**. Yin yoga postures, which appear as modifications of traditional asanas, apply moderate stress to the connective tissue (tendons, ligaments, fascia) in order to improve blood flow and nutrient provision to the joints. A more meditative approach to asana, yin yoga is however about more than cultivating inner silence. The YogaRuka yin yoga class honours the spirit of its creator, Paulie Zink, who intended it as a practice by itself, since it includes the full range of Taoist yoga, with both yin and yang elements. 

It’s highly recommended to wear multi-layered clothing to keep the joints warm since movement here is spaced and subtle.

#### Partnered Flow

This class is designed for you to **exercise, stretch, strengthen and be playful** with your family member, lover, friend, colleague, or whomever you’d like to bring with you - but you can also partner on the spot with a new person each time. Partnering for postures offers some radical benefits, such as **acquiring balance faster, encouraging trust, enhancing communication and connection**, going much deeper into poses you used to struggle with, helped and supported by your yoga partner. This practice will allow you to also delve into massage techniques and pose adjustment skills.
