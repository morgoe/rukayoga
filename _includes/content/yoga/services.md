#### Open - by Donation

A 75-minute Hatha or Vinyasa Fusion flow. Every ObD will offer a different typology of conscious movement class. But whichever it will feature, it will be the ideal way to jumpstart the weekend with creative flow sequences, at times some partner work, and every time a thorough relaxation and meditation. This class is open to everyone, beginner to advanced, and it’s donation based (pay what feels right). You are welcome even if you don’t have any sort of membership with us.

50% of the revenue accrued from these donations will be directed toward the charities and trust funds we support. Please see Charities for more information.
