#### Private Sessions

Private yoga fusion tuition, Stretch Therapy, Yoga Therapy, and/or breathing techniques (Pranayama) adjusted to your very specific needs, via a full anatomical assessment. By far the best way to begin a regular, personalised, physical practice, and to gradually bring your body and mind to a state of balance and wellbeing. 
It can be held at the YogaRuka studio, at the student’s domicile, or via Skype.
