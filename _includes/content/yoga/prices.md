We are always happy to welcome new students experience our very exclusive space and method and take the time they need to figure which classes and times fit best within their schedule. 
The Introductory offer has been created for you to enjoy unlimited classes for two weeks from the day of purchase so it's a very good starting point. 

If you are after a taster pack for your kid(s), we have a 3-class pack option below. 

If you are an expectant mother, great news! We have recently partnered with Mother Nurture Yoga, Sydney's leading Pregnancy Yoga School, and packs are to be purchased through them, that can be used at our location but also at any of their other locations throughout the Sydney area (CBD, Chatswood, Hornsby, and more). 


#### Intro 14 Day Pass

**$39**: available strictly for new students who have not attended any classes at YogaRuka before; **valid for 14 consecutive days** (starting from the date of purchase), one pass per person.

For absolute freedom and no commitments whatsoever, you can always simply book a drop-in class. 

#### Drop-in Class

**$25**: welcome to book a one-off group class anytime.


Once you've used up your Intro pass, we have 3 easy multi-class pass options to cover for all situations and necessities. 
We want to keep things very simple so all you ever need to worry about is your practice! 


#### 10-Class Pack

**$200**: optimal for those who want to practice once a week or even once a fortnight. This pass is a really sweet deal (you basically pay for 8 classes and get 2 more free!) and is **valid for twenty weeks** (five months). It can make for a wonderful gift for a dear one and it can be used for any group classes of your choice. 

#### Monthly Membership

**$175**: it gives you access to **unlimited classes** - even several daily if youâ€™re up for it. Renewal is not automated and there is **no commitment to a contract.** At any point you can switch to a 10-class pass or upgrade to the 3-month membership. 

#### 3 Month Membership

**$420**: it comes down to **only $140 per month** and gives you access to **unlimited classes** - it is the most efficient way for you to begin and/or maintain a consistent practice. Instead of a commitment to a contract, you simply pay your 3 months upfront and get a 20% discount on the full price. Which converts to **as much as 18 days of free practice!**

Other 3 month membership benefits include:

- 10% discount off retail products
- 10% discount off workshops, seminars and retreats 
- **no contract, no hidden fees, no small writing conditions**
