We are always happy to welcome new students experience our very exclusive space and method and take the time they need to figure which classes and times fit best within their schedule. 
  
The Introductory offer has been created for you to enjoy unlimited classes for two weeks from the day of purchase so it's a very good starting point. 

If you are after a taster pack for your kid(s), we have a 3-class pack option below. 

If you are an expectant mother, great news! We have recently partnered with Mother Nurture Yoga, Sydney's leading Pregnancy Yoga School, and packs are to be purchased through them, that can be used at our location but also at any of their other locations throughout the Sydney area (CBD, Chatswood, Hornsby, and more).
