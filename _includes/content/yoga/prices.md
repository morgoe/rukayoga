We are always happy to welcome new students experience our very exclusive space and method and take the time you need to figure which classes and times fit best within your schedule. 

The Introductory offer has been created for you to enjoy unlimited classes for two weeks from the day of purchase to help you figure out the right frequency and the typology of class/es that works best for you. 

If you are expecting, or a neo-mum that would like to share yoga with her bub, you are in the right place: We are partnered with Mother Nurture Yoga, Sydney's leading Pregnancy Yoga School, and you can purchase a pass directly through them, that can be used at our location but also at any of their other locations throughout the Sydney area (CBD, Chatswood, Parramatta, Hornsby, and more).
