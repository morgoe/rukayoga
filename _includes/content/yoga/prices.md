We are thrilled to welcome new students experience our very exclusive method and take the time to figure which classes and times fit best within your schedule. 

We have created one unified pass to make it all very simple: $20 weekly for unlimited live-streamed classes. 

Take your time to figure out the right frequency and the classes that work best for you, and watch this space since we'll be announcing soon pre-recorded classes on-demand for those times you can't join any live class on schedule!  



### Monthly Membership

**$20/wk (billed monthly)**: it gives you access to **unlimited classes**. Renewal is automated. 

Anyone present in the house (same IP address) can take any class, so please feel free to invite the whole family to join in. If you want and **can afford** supporting us, however, please consider buying individual memberships.
