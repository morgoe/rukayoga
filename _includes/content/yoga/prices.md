We are always happy to welcome new students to experience our unique space and method, so the Introductory offer has been created for you, to enjoy unlimited classes for two weeks from the day of purchase. 


#### Intro 14 Day Pass

**$39**: available strictly for new students who have not attended any classes at YogaRuka before; **valid for 14 consecutive days** (starting from the date of purchase), one pass per person.

For absolute freedom and no commitments whatsoever, you can always simply book a drop-in class. 

#### Drop-in Class

**$25**: welcome to book a one-off class anytime

Once you've used up your Intro pass, we have 4 very simple multi-class pass options to cover for all situations and necessities. 

#### 5 Class Pack

**$110**: optimal for those who want to practice occasionally. This pass saves you money (-12% on the full price) and is **valid for three months**. Great to offer it as a gift to a friend or family member!

#### 10 Class Pack

**$200**: optimal for those who want to practice once a week or even once a fortnight. This pass is a really sweet deal (you basically pay for 8 classes and get 2 more free!) and is **valid for five months**.

#### Monthly Membership

**$175**: gives you access to **unlimited classes** - even several daily if youâ€™re up for it. No commitment to a contract. Renew or upgrade to the 3-month membership. 

#### 3 Month Membership

**$420**: comes down to **only $140 per month** and gives you access to **unlimited classes** - it is the most efficient way for you to begin and/or maintain a consistent practice. Instead of a commitment to a contract, you simply pay your 3 months upfront and get a 20% discount on the full price. Which converts to as much as 18 days of free practice!!

Other 3 month membership benefits include:

- 10% discount off retail products
- 10% discount off workshops, seminars and retreats 
- the option to suspend membership anytime
- exclusive member deals and offers
