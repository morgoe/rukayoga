      <p>Karen first got into yoga when work stress forced her to start taking care of her mental and emotional health. Her first class was challenging but revitalising, and she realised that yoga was the next step in her journey.</p>

      <p>A personal crisis led her to reflect on her priorities, and she felt her true purpose was to help, contribute, and serve through the yogic principles that had so improved her own life.</p>

      <p>Her biggest motivation for teaching yoga is bringing to each of her students strength, stillness, awareness and resilience. Her classes involve flows, long holds, meditation and breath work.</p>

      <p>Rua is co-founder and owner of YogaRuka.</p>

      <p>From a history as a teacher of sciences, to a journalist writing about the Mafia in the heated Neapolitan metropolis, to a multi-disciplinary artist fiddling with print and the web, Rua has changed lives a few times over. The only thing that​ has been​stick​ing​​ throughout​is her passion for learning​,​and sharing mindful experiences rather than just knowledge - and that’s how today she is a dedicated meditation facilitator, a stretch therapist and a multi-style yoga instructor.</p>

      <p>​She is striving​ to teach - or perhaps even better, facilitate yoga, and movement - the way​ she would have always wanted to be taught. ​Her long-term goal is to gather around ​her a new generation of practitioners who think of yoga​​and all its​ ​offshoots critically, not superstitiously, who aspire to work healthily and live mindfully; to offer a resource for those who want to approach it from a different angle; to offer a space for those who have tried and failed to get into it many times before, to try once more.</p>

      <p>Morgan was a very unathletic child who found his way into a gym at age 20, where finally he thrived in a non-competitive environment. However, being unconditioned, he quickly collected some injuries. He turned to yoga, and then other methodologies like Stretch Therapy and Fighting Monkey, which not only rehabbed his injuries, but to his surprise turned him into someone “athletic”.</p>

      <p>His classes are a mix of everything he’s ever tried, as he believes variability is the key to good health and good movement.</p>

{% include components/media.html image="/assets/images/teachers/anakin.jpg" title="Anakin Wagner" body="Anakin is from Stockholm, Sweden with a background in engineering. He went to his first yoga class to balance a stagnant life in front of the computer. Naturally drawn to the practice the activity turned into a hobby and later developed into a lifestyle with mobility and movement in focus. After years of Yoga and Meditation practice he traveled to India to receive teacher training  and started instructing classes in 2018.<br/><br/>His own practice is multidisciplinary and this variety is reflected in his teachings where traditional elements of Hatha and Ashtanga Yoga is combined with practices from other fields. Acrobatics, Qi Gong, Movement and Breath work are often mixed with Yoga in a playful manner. The classes aim to inspire curiosity towards movement and have the students leave each class challenged and energised." %}
