title: 'Bandha — Exploring the Core'
location: 'Plymouth, UK'
dates: '18<span class="superscript">th</span> September 2016'
description: "Your core is your motion stabiliser and force transfer center - it's what keeps you going even while not moving. Against common belief, it includes much more than your abdominal wall muscles, such as: your rib muscles, para-vetrebral muscles, but also the profound diaphragm, the pelvic floor, the elusive psoas, the glutes... It also constitutes your foundation, the centre of your balance and stability and even sense of self. But office jobs and modern lifestyle leave it weak."

Your core is your motion stabiliser and force transfer center - it's what keeps you going even while not moving. Against common belief, it includes much more than your abdominal wall muscles, such as: your rib muscles, para-vetrebral muscles, but also the profound diaphragm, the pelvic floor, the elusive psoas, the glutes... It also constitutes your foundation, the centre of your balance and stability and even sense of self. But office jobs and modern lifestyle leave it weak.

Also yoga can often confuses us with suggestions like, "relax your bum” - not a great idea since gaining a soft posterior will in time only help destabilise you.

Good thing this workshop comes to save you and - pun intended - rock you to your core! Going through this 100' intense session with Rua will give you the appropriate tools to:

<ul class="list-bullets">
	<li>increase your sheer strength and endurance;</li>
	<li>massage internal organs and prevent digestive tract diseases;</li>
	<li>enhance metabolism, slim the waistline;</li>
	<li>re-energise; </li>
	<li>learn how to manage, prevent and repair damages caused by a sedentary lifestyle;</li>
	<li>build awareness of bad postural habits to prevent lumbago and sciatica (or more bluntly put, back and butt pains).</li>
</ul>
