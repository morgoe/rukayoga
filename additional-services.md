## Private Sessions

Private yoga fusion tuition, Stretch Therapy, Yoga Therapy, and/or breathing techniques (Pranayama) adjusted to your very specific needs, via a full anatomical assessment. By far the best way to begin a regular, personalised, physical practice, and to gradually bring your body and mind to a state of balance and wellbeing. It can be held at the YogaRuka studio, at the student’s domicile, or via Skype.

At request it can include a longer or shorter relaxation, or none at all. Sensitive to trauma, we can do hands-on adjustments or just verbal cueing. We can discuss the best diet to integrate with your training. We also impart private classes on meditation techniques, kids’ yoga private classes, yoga for the disabled, and more. Please [be in touch](/contact) with any questions.

Facilitated by our teachers in function of their area of expertise, these classes can also be given in other languages than English (at the moment - Spanish, Italian and French).

## Kids Yoga

Yoga for children in a non-competitive and supportive environment. It will help noticeably improve focus and concentration, self-esteem, reading retention, and motor skills of kids of any age. Using engaging games and activities, kids and adolescents can expect to have a blast while learning individual and partnered postures, breathing and relaxation techniques, and meditation.

Class themes will center around specific needs for every age group (5-8, tweens, teens).

You can also book private classes for your child, or for a small group of special needs children - please [contact us](/contact) to enquire.
