I have always been scientifically inclined and skeptical to a fault. Thus it came as a big surprise for those who knew me to hear I had gone to India to train as a yoga teacher. Abandoning my latest gig: a very promising - and joyless - career in Australian corporate IT. 

There’s a quote from Richard Bach’s “Illusions” that comes to mind whenever I think of myself as a teacher of yoga: “You teach best what you most need to learn.”
Having experimenting with yoga for years without finding my way, I am today in the position of saying that it might just be okay to not find your way as long as you keep on actively looking, listening, experiencing, and not losing touch with our incredible habitat.
I believe in sharing yoga as the integrative phenomenon that it is, not as a sport - that’s asana, which is only one of its 8 limbs - at the same time taking the effort to understand and filter through the mirages and explore what works for the individual.
Yoga asana is exercise with the potential to be infinitely more, but that doesn’t mean it needs to be religion. Rather, it’s discipline within yourself, it’s an ever expanding journey. 

What I am striving for is teach - or perhaps even better, facilitate yoga, and movement - the way I would have always wanted to be taught. My long-term goal is to gather around me a new generation of practitioners who think of yoga, and all its variations on the theme, and offshoots - critically, not superstitiously, who aspire to work healthily and live mindfully; to offer a resource for those who want to approach it from a different angle; to offer a space for those who have tried and failed to get into it many times before, to try once more.
In fact, the more I ponder upon it, I’d like to be seen as a movement facilitator, not as an instructor. I ease - I don’t direct. Direction is everyone’s to find in their own, private experience.
One size fits all won’t do for me. “Adapting yoga to suit the needs of every unique individual is where the true greatness of yoga lies” as TKV Desikachar once put it, and it’s how my classes inevitably develop. They go from yoga fusion to mindful meditation to stretch therapy, in group and one-on-one, travelling and also in our beautiful new studio in Sydney. I organise wellness retreats and workshops, and still sometimes I work on independent graphic and photography projects and do journalistic collaborations in and beyond the realm of movement.

My personal practice is what keeps me grounded to the present moment and has re-established a long lost connection between my body and mind.
