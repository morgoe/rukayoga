## Step 1. Buy a Package

We use a booking app called [Momoyoga](https://www.momoyoga.com/yogaruka/). When you click through to buy your very first pass, you’ll need to pop in your deets and choose a password. Once you’ve registered, simply choose either the:

- Unlimited membership subscription ($20/wk billed monthly)
- Drop-in class ($20/class)

We’ll activate this on your first class. You can pay for your package online. At $20/wk, our membership is less than a cup of coffee per day.

## Step 2. Join our Facebook group

Once you subscribe, we’ll add you to our members-only Facebook group. Here, you’ll be kept up to date with classes, and be able to chat to our teachers and other students.

If you’re not on Facebook, don’t worry, it’s not essential to take our classes.

## Step 3. Download Zoom

We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for our live-streamed classes.

You can download it on your phone, tablet or laptop. We recommend your laptop: the bigger the screen, the better you’ll be able to follow along.

We **strongly encourage** using your video during the class, so we can pay attention to how everyone is doing. However, this is completely optional.

## Step 4. Book a Class

Choose any class from our jam-packed [timetable](/timetable/) and book in! It’s important to book in **before** the class so that we can send you the right link at the right time.

## Step 5. Experience the class

Around 10-15 minutes before the class, you’ll receive a link to the Zoom live-stream. You’ll receive this both by email and on the Facebook group, as long as you’ve booked in beforehand. If you forgot to book, just give us a yell on Facebook and we’ll sort you out!

Whether you are new to Yoga and Calisthenics, or an advanced practitioner of any sport, you are entering a new space and approaching a new method. 

In addition to those comfy clothes we encourage you to wear Shoshin: the beginner’s mind. It’s the attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level. Just as a beginner would. (Ain’t Zen Buddhism great!) Pay attention to the instructions, and try to not default to automatic pilot, even if the practice feels familiar. If you do not understand something, or if it doesn’t feel quite right, don’t be shy - inform your teacher!

**Do**: rest whenever necessary, let your teacher know if you feel sudden pains you are not used to 

**Don’t**: be late or leave early (except in cases of emergency)

## Step 6. Hang around for a chat!

After each class, we all like to hang around for a bit. You can ask questions about poses in the class, let us know how you felt, or just have a chat. We’re all feeling a bit cooped up these days, so having some sense of community is really important.
